  (text "Comments:\n\n- The I2C address is 0x42 (pg 15 in datasheet). Put something like \"Addr: 0x42\" in a text label near the bottom right\n	of the chip so we know for future reference. \n\n- Since we are using I2C, we do not need the UART pins. Mark RXD and TXD as no connect\n\n- RF_IN: This is the main antenna connection, connect it to the SMA connector that is in the parts library under the\n	 name \"CONSMA020.062-G\". Pin 2 of that sma connector is the shield and should just go to ground. \n\n- Page 11 of the daatasheet: both VCC and VCC_IO are the supply pins. Connect both of these to 3.3v. Since they are the main supply\n	pins put two 100n capacitors on the schematic between 3.3v and gnd. These are decoupling capacitors that need to be placed \n	near the chip on the pcb. To help us remember, place them physically close to the vcc pins on the schematic. Check the \n	microcontroller schematic for an example.\n\n- On page 28 of the M10s integration manual (I just added this to datasheets), it says to leave the V_BCKP pin disconnected \n	if a backup supply is not used. Thus put a no connect on the V_BCKP pin. \n\n- On page 6 of the M10s integration manual, it says that VCC_RF is an optional voltage output for powering an optional external\n	LNA or active antenna. Since we are using a passive antenna just put a no connect on the VCC_RF pin. \n\n- Since there is no external LNA mark the LNA_EN as disabled\n\n- The Timepulse pin can be used to output a very precise time signal (gps atomic clock precision). We don't need it so just \n	mark it as no connect\n\n- The ExtInt pin is a configurable interrupt. We don't really have the need or pins for this so just mark it as no connect. \n\n- SDA and SCL are the I2C data lines, connect them to hierarchical labels so that we can connect them to the microcontroller\n	outside this schematic\n\n- The safeboot pin is used for flashing the chip firmware. We do not need to do this (hopefully) so just mark it as no connect.\n	\n- The VIO_SEL selects the I/O voltage for the module. According to page 9 of the datasheet, this pin should be left open (unconnected)\n	for 3.3v logic levels. As such, mark this pin as no connect. \n\n- NOTE!!!: We need to check the max10s footprint, i briefly looked at it and i\n	thought all the pins were reveresed when comparing it to the datasheet.\n	Unsure if datasheet is not clear or if the kicad footprint is backwards\n\n			-Seth"
